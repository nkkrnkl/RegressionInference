In this Jupyter Lab, I'll be analyzing the relationship between draft position and success in the NFL (National Football League). The NFL draft is an annual event in which every NFL team takes turns choosing players that they will add to their team. There are around 200 selections, called "picks" made every year, although this number has changed over the years.

The `nfl` table has five columns, the name of the `Player`, the `Salary` that player made for the 2019 season, the year that player was drafted (`Year Drafted`), the number of the draft pick that was used when the player was drafted (`Pick Number`), and the `Position` in football that player plays.

Each row in `nfl` corresponds to one player who played in the 2019 season.
